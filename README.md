French mathematician Joseph Fourier demonstrated 200 years ago the following principle: given a periodic function of period $$T$$, one can decompose it using cosine and sine components of different order:

$$f(t) = \sum\limits_{n = -\infty}^{+\infty}c_n(f)e^{int\frac{2\pi}{T}}$$

with $a_0$ being a constant value, $a_n$ the cosine component of order $n$, and $b_n$ the sine component of order $n$. These components can themselve be calculated thanks to the function:

$$a_n(f) = \frac{2}{T}\int_0^T f(t)cos(nt\frac{2\pi}{T})dt$$

$$b_n(f) = \frac{2}{T}\int_0^T f(t)sin(nt\frac{2\pi}{T})dt$$
